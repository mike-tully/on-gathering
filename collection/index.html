        Public spaces are fraught and in rough shape in the 21st century. Privatization, corporatization, digitization—there are many forces that seek to dominate, simulate, or replace public spheres as we know them. PUBLICLY SPACED is a compilation of research I’ve taken on to understand why shared public spaces are worthy of our attention today and what their composition might look like in direct and abstract ways. In an effort to better understand what they are and how they are, it is my hope that it might become more valued and produce conditions for more actively shared spaces that are more inclusive, equitable, and lively. I would also argue that this is more important than ever, a familiar call, but one that stems from having seen the world moved online into corporatized public spaces in the past year due to the pandemic, and the physical public spaces in our surroundings becoming unpopulated. Understanding this condition of digital and physical primacy may help us more fully inhabit both realms in the coming future.
