        A question that dances across my mind on occasion is best articulated by William H. Whyte in his research project turned book turned documentary, <i>The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces</i>:

        <blockquote>
        “If good places are so felicitous, why are there not more of them?”

    This brings to mind the occasional necessity of exploration to find spaces that fit us as much as we fit them. In an article for <i>Art in America</i>, Josie Thaddeus-Johns questions the relationships, historical and contemporary, between panaromas and tourism. She asks:<br>
    
    <blockquote cite="https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/virtual-tourism-painted-panoramas-1234582258/">
    “In today’s world of screens, the visual trickery employed by panoramas doesn’t have the allure it once did. What kind of simulacra hold our interest now?”

    Perhaps even more linked to the quotidian of our newfound isolation initiated by the pandemic, A.S. Hamrah laments the loss of quietude in social spaces such as at the movies:<br>
    
    <blockquote>
    “Even so, in a movie theater, you were alone with strangers, sharing in the communal act of watching shadows on a screen. There was power in that. Now, merely alone, a blue light shines in your eyes. In the world of streaming, there is no such thing as society.”<br>

Each of these individuals provide examples of the myriad of ways in which public space is shaped, where and how it can be found, and the benefits, dilemmas, and paradigms they present us with. There are clearly both benefits and detriments to these spaces in their iterations over time, which brings to mind a term by the filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha of “speaking nearby”, elaborated upon by Cathy Park Hong in her book <i>Minor Feelings</i>. To quote from the <i>Artforum</i> article in which it was first printed, Minh-ha suggests:

    </div>
    </div>  
    

    <div class="rotate-wrapper">
    <div class="rotate">
    <blockquote>
 “When you decide to speak nearby, rather than speak about, the first thing you need to do is to acknowledge the possible gap between you and those who populate your film: in other words, to leave the space of representation open so that, although you’re very close to your subject, you’re also committed to not speaking on their behalf, in their place, or on top of them. You can only speak nearby, in proximity (whether the other is physically present or absent), which requires that you deliberately suspend meaning, preventing it from merely closing and hence leaving a gap in the formation process. This allows the other person to come in and fill that space as they wish. Such an approach gives reedom to both sides and this may account for it being taken up by filmmakers who recognize in it a strong ethical stance. By not trying to assume a position of authority in relation to the other, you are actually freeing yourself from the endless criteria generated with such an all-knowing claim and its hierarchies in knowledge.”

        Minh-ha’s sentiment is particularly notable because not only does it evoke the idea of physical space, but because it insinuates that it has the capability to be present in every conversation that we have, leaving enough room for whatever needs to be said next.

        What's intriguing to me about this documentary is the insistence of "subconscious" participation in the creation of public space, by the removal of something adorned on it, creating an entirely new piece of art in the void of where one formerly existed. By any enntities insistence that they are removing grafitti for perhaps hegemonic aeshtetic reasons, they are inadvertently leaving a new public artwork in its wake.

        This past week I joined a thesis group of M.Arch Students at RISD as a visiting critic while they shared their project presentations and research. One student's research focused on public spaces and we entered into a lively discussion of how the are formed. They pointed to this temporary building space, <a href="https://assemblestudio.co.uk/projects/theatre-on-the-fly" target="_blank">Theatre on the Fly</a>, constructed by a theater in England that navigated the architectural boundaries of what's public and private.

        The student argued that the building contained in its design a quality to invite people both inside and out, by way of its large openings and semi-opaque siding that could provide at a glimpse a sense of what might be going on in the space at any given moment. We discussed the ideas of "blended spaces" – something somewhere between inside and out, away from a quite literal architectural binary.

        I'm curious if there is a digital equivalent to what the student argued as being the benefit of this space – something that invites people both inside and outside, promoting circulation but also giving a sense of "blended spaces" as was discused. Are there "blended spaces" <i>inside</i> of digital spaces? or do they require some measure of physicality as a counter-balance?

        In the process of reading a book on the work of Robert Ashley entitled <i>Yes, But Is It Edible?</i>, I read this passage that Alex Waterman cites in relation to constructing landscapes witihin narratives and stories. It is an excerpt from “Plays” by Gertrude Stein and muses on the landscapes role and construction:

        The essay continues to go on to describe how Robert Ashley's work, specifically within the televised opera <i>Perfect Lives</i> looks to the landscape almost like a character within the narrative – morphing, growing, and moving throughout the performance just as its human counterparts are. What is distinguishable about the use of the landscape in the opera and the way Alex Waterman writes about it is how it identifies landscapes, public space, and <i>space in general</i> as a binding element between the lives of everyday people.

        In our past class session, Mindy shared a reference to an art project in the late-80s that speaks to this kind of paradigm in a more visual manner. The project is entitled <i>Legible City</i> and was created by the artist Jeffrey Shaw in 1989. A description reads, "The Legible City is a pioneering interactive art installation where the visitor rides a stationary bicycle through a simulated representation of a city that is constituted by computer-generated, three-dimensional letters that form words and sentences along the sides of the streets. Using the ground plans of actual cities—Manhattan, Amsterdam and Karlsruhe—The Legible City completely replaces the existing architecture of these cities with text formations written and compiled by Dirk Groeneveld. Travelling through these cities of words is consequently a journey of reading; choosing the path one takes creates a recombination of these texts, and spontaneous conjunctions of meaning."

        I went to Yale's Sterling Library in search of books related to Public Space to cast a wider net with my research. One of the books that I requested is <i>Public Space? Lost and Found</i> (MIT Press, 2017) and contains a terrific cross-section of critical essays, analysis, and artist-led projects on the topic matter. Here is one such excerpt from an essay titled "The Public Sphere is Our Abyss" by Néstor García Canclini which questions the dire condition of public spaces today:

        In addition to the essays in the book, I noticed a section on the artwork of Krzysztof Wodiczko, a polish artist known for technology-driven artworks that involve projections on building facades and social interventions in public spaces. Below is a photo of the project in midtown Manhattan. According to Wodiczko’s website, “The vehicle was tested and used by homeless people in New York and Philadelphia. Created in response to a growing number of homeless people, approaching 100,000 in New York City in the late 1980s, the vehicle was meant to combine practical and symbolic functions, offering strategies of survival to homeless people while calling into question the economic and political systems responsible for their marginalization. For Wodiczko, this project is an example of what he calls “scandalous functionalism,” since it responds to needs whose existence is a social and political scandal. Made of aluminum, steel mesh, sheet metal, and plexiglas, the vehicle’s construction has been associated with constructivist functionalism and military technology used as an “anti-anti-homeless device.””

        Something about the project had seemed familiar to me and I began to remember that earlier this year, while over break and back in New York, I encountered a similar project by Wodiczko on view at the Queens Museum in their exhibition <i>After the Plaster Foundation, or, "Where can we live?"</i>. With my classmate Miguel, we walked through the exhibition and encountered Wodiczko’s <i>Poliscar</i> (1991), a similar vehicular design to the project above. Wodiczko describes the project explaing that “Poliscar is the design of a vehicle whose name alludes to the Greek name for a city-state, conveying the idea of creating a polis for the homeless by means of a vehicle that would help them communicate and gain visibility in public space.”

        Not all of Wodiczko‘s work is meant to provide human-scale vehicles or tools – some are meant to project the presence of individuals in public into larger scales than typically acheivable. One such example is <i>The Tijuana Projection</i> (2001) where Wodiczko created devices for “a group of Mexican women who now spoke about their often traumatic experiences, sexual harassment at the workplace, domestic violence, family disintegration, police brutality. The pre-recorded statements were interrupted and rounded out live in response to viewer reactions. In Tijuana the participants took part in the live projection for the first time, thanks to a special head-mounted device comprising a camera, a microphone, and a portable transmitter. Blown-up to huge dimensions, the “live” faces of six women and their amplified voices, speaking of issues that had until now been mostly taboo, meant the projection spectacularly claimed the city’s public space.”

        A recent example of accessibility and architecture that I've encountered in New Haven comes to mind. While I was returning home in the early morning hours after a long night of work with my classmate and roommate, we noticed that as we were walking across the street the beeping noise from the crosswalk signals was beginning to become more noticable with the absence of traffic noise. As we continued to walk through the streets, we noticed that at various intersections with more crosswalks the sounds became louder and more numerous, starting to echo across the valleys of streets between buildings. Soon we were overcome by a polyrythmm of beeps, echoing on top of one another and vaulting through space. It was one of the most prononunced moments of accessibility that I've seen integrated into the walking context of a built environment.
        </div>
        </div>


        <div class="rotate-wrapper">
        <div class="rotate">
       There was something dually moving about this experience. One aspect was that accessibility became the prime condition of how we were guided to move through this space, rather than the secondary. I think of it as more common to see an accessibility ramp or all-gender restroom to the side, away from what architecture has designated as the primary set of choices of space. The other aspect that was so refreshing was how this moment of sounds begin to transcend accessibility and create a new experienceo of the city. Something functional and designed as a utility to help seeing-impaired individuals was now a soundscape that all could inhabit together, creating something borderline-artistic out of something pragmatic.

        <div class="rotate-wrapper">
        <div class="non-rotate">
       This brings to mind a few past experiments or proposals from different artists to leverage the shared soundscape as a public space in and of itself. Both David Byrne and James Murphy have presented proposals to or exhibitions in the city of New York relating to this. Byrne's <a href="http://davidbyrne.com/explore/playing-the-building"><i>Playing the Building</i></a> art installation utilized different methods to conjure sounds out of the building it inhabited and subsequently the bodies inhabiting that space. Murphy's proposal <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/66627-james-murphys-subway-symphony-installed-at-underground-park-in-new-york/"><i>Subway Symphonies</i></a>, underwritten by a corporate sponsor and notably woven into the larger downtown development project The Lowline, suggested that the subway turnstiles that transit-goers pass through could be re-configured as instruments, producing different symphonies of noise at each station, creating more harmonic definitions of place across the city. As you might imagine, there are mixed reactions to these latter suggestions of space by Murphy. Some have embraced them as a shared arts experience in public while other's rightly critiquing their assistance in the harmful process of gentrification of New York's Lower East Side.

        The article presents four case studies on the fraught condition of public space as its encountered currently in several cities, ranging from anti-homless architecture to accessibility as an integral quality to architecture. One quote I found particularly resonant about a call for sensitivity to these issues was that "Real progress will come when we stop thinking about accessibility as an obstacle to architecture and see it instead as the reason architecture exists." This role-reversal reconfigures the formula of architecture of being inclusive rather than becoming inclusive. In addition to accesibility practices, the article addresses gender-neutral bathrooms, healthcare clinic guidelines, and so forth. Photographs below, taken by Daniel Terna for the magazine, depict these case studies.
