    <p>
        Subsonic is a (formerly) open source software tool for compiling, running, and hosting a media library. The word itself is a term that refers to any speed lower than the speed of sound within a sound-propogating medium. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Jazz Funk Greats is a private, crowd-sourced music collection hosted on a subsonic server and tended to by myself and a small group of friends. The name itself refers to an album titled “20 Jazz Funk Greats” by the English industrial post-punk and visual arts group Throbbing Gristle, led by the late Genesis P-Orridge.<br><br>

     <p>
        Essentially, we utilize this software platform to avoid exploitative streaming platforms and share music that we've purchased with one another. Becuase the software platform is multi-faceted, it is capable of integrating web radio streams, podcast feeds, in addition to other features. The design of the platform is customizable itself, allowing for different customizable "themes" to dictate the general appearance. This vessel is flexible to an extent, but has its limits. If the software platform had continued to stay open source, there would be more potential for molding it to its use perhaps.

    <p>
        A surprising aspect to the collection, which is both intentional and not, is that it is decentralized and supported by baseline features in the platform. Anyone has the capability to invite someone to join and set up an account for that person, who in turn, inherits the same privelages. Anyone can upload or download files to the platform. Anyone can control macro network features (associated URL, etc) and micro features (maximum bitrate of uploaded files, etc). It is a self-governed entity, which is a serious way of a saying that it is a record shop on the internet that we maintain for each other.
